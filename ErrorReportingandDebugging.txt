# Error Reporting and Debugging
# Overview: this lab focuses on how to use Cloud Error Reporting and integrate Cloud Debugger.
# Objectives:
1. Launch a simple Google App Engine application
2. Introduce an error into the application
3. Explore Cloud Error Reporting
4. Use Cloud Debugger to identify the error in the code
5. Fix the bug and monitor in Cloud Operations

# Task 1: Create an application: first we will create a local folder and get the App Engine Hello world application by running the code:
mkdir appengine-hello
cd appengine-hello
gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/archinfra/gae-hello/* .

#Next we run the application using the local development server in Cloud Shell by running the command:
dev_appserver.py $(pwd)

# We Deploy the application to App Engine using the command:
gcloud app deploy app.yaml

# We enter the number corresponding to a region when propted:
# When prompted, type Y to continue.
# When the process is done, We verify that the application is working by running the following command:
gcloud app browse

# If needed, press Ctrl+C to exit the development mode.
# Next we Introduce an error to break the application
# To examine the main.py file, run the following command:
cat main.py

#We will break the configuration by replacing the import library with one that doesnt exist.
# we use the sed stream editor to change the import library to the nonexistent webapp22, by running the command:
sed -i -e 's/webapp2/webapp22/' main.py

# To verify the change made in the main.py file, run the following command:
cat main.py

# Notice that the application now tries to import webapp22.
# We now Re-deploy the application to App Engine using the command:
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quiet

#When the process is done, verify that the application is broken by running the following command:
gcloud app browse

# If needed, press Ctrl+C to exit development mode.

# Task 2: Explore Cloud Error Reporting: View Error Reporting and trigger additional errors
You should see an error regarding the failed import of webapp22.

# In Cloud Shell, run the following command:

gcloud app browse

#The First seen and Last seen columns show when the error was first seen and when it was last seen, respectively. This can help identify changes that might have triggered the error. In this case, it was the upload of the new version of app engine code.


# In Cloud Shell, fix the error by running the following command:
sed -i -e 's/webapp22/webapp2/' main.py

# To re-deploy the application to App Engine, run the following command:
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --quiet

# When the process is done, to verify that the application is working again, run the following command:
gcloud app browse
