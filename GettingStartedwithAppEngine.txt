
# Title: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

# Overview: In this lab, we will create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google Cloud Shell.

# Objectives:
# 1. Initialize App Engine.

# 2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

# 3. Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.


# To list the active account we will be working with we run the command:
gcloud auth list

# To verify the project ID, we run:

gcloud config list project


# Task 1: Initialize App Engine

# To Initialize our App Engine app with our project and choose its region, we run:

gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

# Next we Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

# Then we Navigate to the source directory:

cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world


# Task 2: Run Hello World application locally
# we Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.

sudo apt-get update

# Next we Set up a virtual environment in which we will run our application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.

sudo apt-get install virtualenv

# If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.

virtualenv -p python3 venv

# To Activate the virtual environment.

source venv/bin/activate

# Then we Navigate to our project directory and install dependencies.

pip install  -r requirements.txt

# To Run the application:

python main.py

# In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.


# Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
# To deploy our application to the App Engine Standard environment: Navigate to the source directory:

cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

# To Deploy our Hello World application.

gcloud app deploy

# If prompted "Do we want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.

# Launch our browser to view the app at http://our_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

gcloud app browse

# Then we Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.
